# Findings

Non-obvious lessons, each with where it was seen. Newest last.

## Omarchy's unattended install needs the disk passphrase in `user_credentials.json`

Seen: Omarchy 4.0.5 release ISO (iso commit 3872d5a), October 2026, building the lab (`test/vm/install.sh`).

The omarchy-iso README says encryption is configured by the `disk_encryption` block in `user_configuration.json`.
With the passphrase only there, archinstall installs the disk **unencrypted** without a word. The install then halts
at its last phase ("Encrypted install but /mnt/boot/limine.conf has no cryptdevice="), because
`user_encrypt_installation.txt` said `true`. The configurator also writes the passphrase as `encryption_password` in
`user_credentials.json`, and that is the copy archinstall reads. Put it in both places.

## A serial port turns Plymouth's disk prompt into plain text

Seen: the lab, Omarchy 4.0.5, October 2026.

With a serial port on the VM, the firmware lists it as a console, systemd's UKI stub appends
`console=uart,io,0x3f8 console=tty0` to the kernel command line (it isn't in the UKI or in `limine.conf`), and Plymouth
then shows a plain-text passphrase prompt instead of Omarchy's themed screen. The busybox and systemd initramfs both
do it. The lab boots with no serial port unless `LAB_SERIAL=1` (only `install.sh` sets it), so its screen matches a
laptop's.

## Omarchy's busybox hooks all have systemd equivalents

Seen: Omarchy 4.0.5 (mkinitcpio 42.2, limine-mkinitcpio-hook 1.40.0, systemd 262), October 2026; spike #3.

| Omarchy (busybox) | systemd initramfs | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `udev` | `systemd` | |
| `keymap`, `consolefont` | `sd-vconsole` | Only when Omarchy bundles `/etc/vconsole.conf` (Latin layouts): sd-vconsole always puts the layout in, and a non-Latin one makes the passphrase untypeable (Omarchy #6229). |
| `encrypt` | `sd-encrypt` | The disk comes from crypttab, not `cryptdevice=`. |
| `btrfs-overlayfs` | `sd-btrfs-overlayfs` | Same package (limine-mkinitcpio-hook). The busybox one is a runscript, which a systemd initramfs never runs: snapshot entries would boot read-only. |
| `resume` | (none) | systemd resumes from `resume=`/`resume_offset=` itself. |
| `plymouth` | `plymouth` | The same hook installs the systemd units (themed prompt confirmed). |

`/etc/crypttab.initramfs` still works but mkinitcpio 42 calls it deprecated: use a line in `/etc/crypttab` with
`x-initrd.attach`. Naming the mapping `root` keeps `/dev/mapper/root`, so `root=` and `resume=` don't change, and
`cryptdevice=` can stay on the command line (ignored by systemd). Omarchy's first-boot setup, factory reset and Quattro
upgrade read `cryptdevice=` to find the LUKS partition (they also fall back to walking the device tree).

## systemd 262's NvPCR setup fails in the lab

Seen: lab VM (swtpm), Omarchy 4.0.5, systemd 262, on every boot including stock. `systemd-tpm2-setup-early`,
`systemd-pcrproduct` and `systemd-pcrlogin@` fail with "Failed to initialize NvPCR index: No such file or directory".
The SRK itself is set up (`SRK already stored in the TPM`), so `systemd-cryptenroll --tpm2-device` is not affected.
The host laptop (systemd 261.2, a hardware TPM) initializes its NvPCRs. Revisit in #5: swtpm or 262?

## Running `omarchy update` in the lab

Seen: Omarchy 4.0.5. A direct `pacman -Syu` is refused by Omarchy's `00-omarchy-update-guard` hook. `omarchy update -y`
over ssh needs `OMARCHY_PATH=/usr/share/omarchy` (the desktop session sets it), passwordless sudo that sorts after
Omarchy's sudoers files, and `Defaults verifypw=any` (its stay-awake step runs `sudo -v`). Even with `-y`, it then
waits at the orphan-packages step; packages, migrations and post-update hooks have run by then.
