# Findings

Non-obvious lessons, each with where it was seen. Newest last.

## Omarchy's unattended install needs the disk passphrase in `user_credentials.json`

Seen: Omarchy 4.0.5 release ISO (iso commit 3872d5a), October 2026, building the lab (`test/vm/install.sh`).

The omarchy-iso README says encryption is configured by the `disk_encryption` block in `user_configuration.json`.
With the passphrase only there, archinstall installs the disk **unencrypted** without a word. The install then halts
at its last phase ("Encrypted install but /mnt/boot/limine.conf has no cryptdevice="), because
`user_encrypt_installation.txt` said `true`. The configurator also writes the passphrase as `encryption_password` in
`user_credentials.json`, and that is the copy archinstall reads. Put it in both places.

## A serial port turns Plymouth's disk prompt into plain text

Seen: the lab, Omarchy 4.0.5, October 2026.

With a serial port on the VM, the firmware lists it as a console, systemd's UKI stub appends
`console=uart,io,0x3f8 console=tty0` to the kernel command line (it isn't in the UKI or in `limine.conf`), and Plymouth
then shows a plain-text passphrase prompt instead of Omarchy's themed screen. The busybox and systemd initramfs both
do it. The lab boots with no serial port unless `LAB_SERIAL=1` (only `install.sh` sets it), so its screen matches a
laptop's.
